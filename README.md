Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a lawyer turned developer currently studying web development (primarily Ruby on Rails and JavaScript). Pretty much every completed project I've worked on is here, from beginner tutorials to Bootcamp coursework to personal projects. You can also follow [my twitter](https://twitter.com/chris_k_dev) where I post regularly about the projects I'm working on.
